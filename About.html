<h2>What is racism?</h2>
<p>Racism has become a big issue today. It basically highlights the race of a person proving him/her better over the other. In other words, it can be said that someone trying to show his or her power among others
 because of being wealthier or belonging to some higher caste or something like this. It may also include prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are
 of a different race or ethnicity, or the belief that members of different races or ethnicities should be treated differently. It is too much raised because of the hate in people among others which rises due to some
 weird reasons like the hated people have different color, they belong to different nation or sometimes, they have different language too. These small reasons have, many times, turned into big fights or wars even.
 Which further influenced slavery forced by the stronger people to the poor ones. This issue has affected mostly the Africans and many parts of Asian countries. In this modern era, it can be seen in society as people
 making others feel lower by showing them weak and proving their abilities over others.</p>
 <h2>Why racism?</h2>
<h3>We make judgment without thinking</h3>
<p>As discussing it further, it has become a big problem that we sometimes make wrong judgment by looking and people. Sometimes without knowing them. For example, labeling somebody by looking at his/her clothes as if someone is wearing simple or traditional
clothes, considering them from rural areas or people belonging to backward class. Even sometimes, judging someone by their nature, i.e., a person who is broad minded and talks frankly to everybody, we sometimes consider that person as flirty or something
like that.</p>
<h3>Not accepting our own mistakes</h3>
<p>It is very big issue of some over-confident people that they do not believe at all that they can be wrong. These people always find, prove themselves right and if anything goes wrong, they start blaming others for the cause even the thing happened
due to them. This happens mostly due to their respect which they have in society, or their status by which society recognizes them by.</p>
