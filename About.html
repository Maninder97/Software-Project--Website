<h2>What is racism?</h2>
<p>Racism is the belief in the superiority of one race over another. It may also include prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are
 of a different race or ethnicity, or the belief that members of different races or ethnicities should be treated differently.[1][2][3] Modern variants of racism are often based
 in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. These views can take the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems in which different 
 races are ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities.</p>
 <h2>Why racism?</h2>
<h3>We’re quick to judge</h3>
<p>We often put labels on people. He dresses like this so
he must be into this music. She goes to that school
so she must be rich. We can also stereotype people
from different racial backgrounds as “lazy”, “brainy”,
“aggro”… you get the idea. The way to beat the
stereotypes? Don’t judge a whole group. Get to know
people from different racial backgrounds and find out
how much you have in common.</p>
<h3>We blame others for our problems</h3>
<p>When we feel angry or frustrated, we often look
for someone else to blame for our problems. As a
community, we can do the same thing. People who
look or talk differently to us are an easy target. You
can hear it happening today in comments like, “those
people take our jobs” or “they get government
handouts all the time”. Nearly all the time, these
statements are wrong.</p>
