<h2>Steps to stop racism</h2>
<h3>Know what you deserve</h3>
<p>
Never pay for the fault or some cause, which is not caused by you or your are not involved in that.
If someone is still trying to put you in trouble without any reason, or teasing you for their own comfort, never 
let them go ahead. Complaint that as soon as possible to any authority according to the condition. For example, if you are
in school, if someone is bullying you without any reason, tell your teacher immediately. It cannot stop everyone, but you can 
get your right and take first step to stop racism.
<br/>
<h3>Knowing your responsibilities</h3>
Following the above information about knowing your rights, it is also your responsibility that if you don't want to be 
a victim of racism, then it is your responsibility that no one else should be treated badly or negatively by you. Apart from that, 
helping others by saving them from bullies and people who promote racism is also your responsibility. Let others feel confident and 
it is only possible, if you will be a good citizen and before that, a good member of the society you are living in. Always treat everyone 
equally whether they belong to your society or from any other.
<br/>
<h3>More crucial steps to stop racism</h3>
Another step to eliminate racial discrimination is promoting equality among people. As we all know, in many parts of the world, 
the political and powerful authorities control people and for their own benefits, they convince people to support them and cleverly 
rise hate between people. What is our step then? The best thing we can do is not to support them if they want our support in this manner.
<br/>
<br/>
 There are still some people present in our society who raise their voices for their rights, but, due to lack of support and power, they are
always ignored and never heard by anyone. Some people want to stand by their side but afraid of the majority which is against them. We should 
never be afraid of those who promote racism. The only way to lower their strength is, supporting the right person, even if it is one or two, if we 
are supporting them, we can encourage more people and the majority will be in our side. 
<br/>
<br/>
 If you belong to higher caste or religion or you are wealthier among your group or society, or anything that makes you better than others, 
 never let it make you over confident. Always engage with others in a manner that they should feel comfortable. Never let them realize that
 they are lower than you or never show that you are above them. 
<br/>
<br/>
Take a stand with your wallet. Know the practices of companies that you invest in and the charities that you donate to. Make an effort to shop at 
small, local businesses and give your money back to the people living in the community. Your state or territory may have a directory of local,
minority-owned businesses in your area.</p>
