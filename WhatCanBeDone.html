<h2>Steps to stop racism</h2>
<h3>Knowing your rights</h3>
<p>
If you think someone is being unfair to you or is bullying you because of your race or colour,
you should tell somebody as soon as possible. Try talking to a parent or teacher if you can.
That doesn’t mean you’re telling tales on someone – it means you are standing up for your rights.
By telling someone, you are taking the first step towards sorting out the problem. You don’t have
to accept it, because it’s not your fault and you haven’t done anything to make people torment you in this way. 
<br/>
<h3>Knowing your responsibilities</h3>
Just as you have the right to expect not to be bullied because of your race or colour, so it is your responsibility
never to treat anyone else badly because of their race or colour. You can do this by making sure you don’t use offensive
racist language, by not using racial stereotypes and by challenging people you hear making racist comments or jokes.
Try to help anyone who is being treated unfairly or bullied. Let them know that they can talk to you and can count on you for support.
<br/>
<h3>More crucial steps to stop racism</h3>
Another step to eliminate racial discrimination is learning to recognize and understand your own privilege.
Racial privilege plays out across social, political, economic, and cultural environments. Checking your privilege and using
your privilege to dismantle systemic racism are two ways to begin this complex process.
<br/>
<br/>
 Another way to address bias and recognize privilege is to support the experiences of other people and engage in tough conversations
 about race and injustice. We cannot be afraid to discuss oppression and discrimination for fear of “getting it wrong.” Take action by
 learning about the ways that racism continues to affect our society. 
<br/>
<br/>
 Do not be afraid to engage in conversations with loved ones, coworkers, and friends. Microaggressions, which can appear in the form of 
 racist jokes or statements, perpetuate and normalize biases and prejudices. Remember that not saying anything – or laughing along – implies
 that you agree.
<br/>
<br/>
Take a stand with your wallet. Know the practices of companies that you invest in and the charities that you donate to. Make an effort to shop at 
small, local businesses and give your money back to the people living in the community. Your state or territory may have a directory of local,
minority-owned businesses in your area.</p>
